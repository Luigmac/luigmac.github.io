<p>A couple of years ago a new life started for us, on the image you can see the source of my happiness and calm, I love my one and only chiquitota!. We were living in Zapopan in the powerful Chonsti, and then we moved to Poland. She has always supported me unconditionally, and I just want to thank her for all the love.</p>
