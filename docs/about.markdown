My name is Luis I come from MÃ©xico and you will se my hobbies and passions reflected in this website. I like math, at the engineering level, I apologize upfront if you come from physics or mathematics you'll freak out. I'm building this website as a personal record but hopefully you can find something interesting for you. I'm attracted to several topics, simple circuits, control theory, machine learning, gardening, cooking and sports. For a couple of years I used the practice parkour, and later  transitioned to climbing beacuse of the lower impact on the knees. If you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out to me.

**This is what you can find in this website:**  
- Research related to power electronics.  
- Bunch of interesting tutorials for applied math topics.  (control theory, programming, DSP, AI, power electronics, optimization).
- Some of the developments working in PLECS.  
- Photos.   
- Storytelling of some adventures.
